That did not happen in this case and 	it is a cause of legitimate criticism which is accepted by the South West water authority.  It is important for us to control such criticism because, although it is true that the authority did not act as it should have acted at the time of the incident, that shortcoming was addressed within two months of the incident, and that addressing of the issue is now more than two years ago.

I find the operation of the Act disturbing.  	It is a charter for those who wish to exploit the horror of people seeking asylum.  I know of cases of Kurdish people fleeing from Turkey and seeking asylum in this country who have paid £1,500 for a one-way air ticket when the normal one-way fare is less than £100.

That power is circumscribed because 	it is a considerable power to which I believe that certain of the dog interests would object strongly.  I do not believe that the RSPCA would welcome the exercise of that power, but I am empowered and, indeed, statutorily required by the Bill to discuss the way in which it is used.

It is a credit to the Met that 137,000 victims were referred to support schemes last year, 29,000 more than ever before.  Bald totals give a false view of crime.  They also underplay police success in tackling crime.  The cornerstone of the Met's response to crime is the partnership approach.  It has produced and is producing success in tackling crime.

It is a crisis for which the Government are overwhelmingly responsible.  Some 11 years ago, this Administration came to power promising to promote higher standards of achievement.  Similar pledges were made in 1983.  The 1987 Conservative manifesto stated: The time has now come for school reform.

The debate continues, and 	it is a debate which has been initiated, led and profoundly influenced by Britain.  The right hon.

I say again to the House that we shall not ask it to do so.  I turn now as the hon.  Member for Middlesbrough (Mr.  Bell) suggested I should, the discussions on economic and monetary union.

It is a con because retail prices have risen less quickly than earnings, but 	it is a double con because research shows that the index for pensioners is considerably different from the price index for the rest of the population.  For example, in the third quarter of 1991 the Government told us that retail prices for all items increased by 4·8 per cent.

Some Labour Members do their best on these occasions to paint a picture of gloom and despondency.  	It is a sad fact that recorded crime in the Metropolitan police district rose by 10 per cent.  to 834,300 in 1990, a slightly slower rate of increase than the national average.

It is a sad irony that one of the two assaults that the Lambeth public transport group describes in its report happened on a bus that had a video camera fitted.

It is a source of considerable satisfaction that that does not appear to be happening in the current recession, although pressure on businesses' costs is intense.

It is about time that we began to take an international and global view rather than shut ourselves into a Europe that does not act in a socially just and reasonable manner.

The idea that everyone can take care of himself is arrant nonsense: everyone requires health facilities and support, and 	it is about time that we recognised the enormous debt that we owe to the pensioners who have put so much into our society.

That figure has now risen to more than 16,000 patients whose lives have been saved by the NHS because of advances in renal medicine.  That is a great success story, of which everyone associated with the NHS has every reason to be proud.  	It is also important to say that we are not complacent about the future development of this aspect of care within the NHS.  My hon.

It is obviously important to keep the sanctions as tight as possible, but 	it is also important that we ensure that Macedonia does not suffer from unintended side effects of the sanctions regime.  We are seeking to address that problem.  As hon.

It is also sometimes argued that other member states do not bother much about this, so why should we? I think that it does matter.

It is also the thrust of Government thinking that everything should be done to avoid the break-up of families which can contribute to delinquency and crime.

It is also vital that all who work at airports should be aware of the constant need for security, and should co-operate in playing their part in the security procedures.

It is also worth remembering that in London arid other metropolitan areas those same local authorities which are now setting standards in homes will be funding the new scheme.

It is appropriate to begin simply by recognising that it is a tragedy and nothing that I can say from the Dispatch Box will change it.

The Secretary of State's speech to the NAHT conference, as many people have told me, confirmed their suspicions.  	It is because of those suspicions that support for the Government's education policies has collapsed severely during the past three years while support for Labour's policies has increased.

We should ensure that it is properly dealt with and brought back to the House as a serious piece of legislation.  It should not be dismissed as a mere 10-minute speech by one hon.

The right hon.  Gentleman has concentrated the attention of the House on an issue that is of real importance in the management not just of West Birmingham district health authority but the whole of the national health service, because 	it is central to the core activity of the NHS that we seek to secure equal access to health care for all our people, whether they come from the relatively leafy areas of Berkshire or Sussex or the more deprived areas of inner-city Birmingham.  The formulae that help to determine the allocation of funds within the health service have an important part to play in the practical delivery of that 	19920211a952_2.txt

The same point applies to the European Community.  As my hon.  Friend said with such force, the United Kingdom has a long-standing relationship with the middle east, as have many other countries in the European Community, such as France.  In years to come, 	it is certain that we in the European Community will be asked to play a part in the economic revival of the region.  My hon.  Friend the Member for Hendon, South said just that.  It would be foolish to make the presence of the European Community, which has an important role to play, a barrier to discussion.  I hope that the state of Israel will show flexibility on that point.  My 	19910523a1055_1.txt

It is not a role which is subordinate to the Twelve — the hon.  Gentleman was mistaken in that — but nor is it a function which will be prejudicial to NATO, which is at the core of our defence arrangements.  However, 	it is certainly a role which will add to Europe's capacity in area and out of area.  The right hon.  Member for Chesterfield (Mr.  Benn) made the type of speech that the House enjoys hearing.  Indeed, it was a pleasure for us to hear him champion the cause of unilateralism.

The ground has been well ploughed and, although this is the first occasion on which I have had to answer a debate on this subject, 	it is certainly not new to the officials who have been discussing it with me today.  The effect of my hon.

As some of the interventions in the debate have illustrated, although our main purpose was to concentrate on 	19901023a311_2.txt

Friend's question, 	it is certainly right that we need to be careful to ensure that policies on agriculture enable developing countries — for these purposes, I include the reforming countries of eastern and of central Europe — to sell to us the goods that they are capable of producing.  It is absurd for us to provide funds for such countries to firm up their economic reforms and, at the same time, to deny them markets 	19901204a202_5.txt

There are thought to be three net contributors to the budget: Germany and Britain, which have always been so, and France, which is now a net contributor, probably a considerable one.  Therefore, three of the four largest member states of the Community have a considerable interest in restraining spending.  The other two countries have a greater interest in 	19911127a1031_1.txt

Friend think that perhaps the appalling working conditions in the Cloisters could be one reason why that distinguished gentleman Mr.  Powell was driven to work in the Library? 	It is certainly something that drove me to work in the Library.  Unfortunately, there are nowhere near enough desks in the Library to accommodate colleagues who find that they cannot work in peace or concentrate in places such as the Cloisters, which is a corridor and a public thoroughfare.	19910319a253_0.txt
149	 This is a matter in which my right hon.  Friend has taken a close interest and we are looking at it carefully.

On the second point, 	it is certainly the case that there are some settlers in northern Cyprus.  It is difficult to know the exact number, but I understand that the proportion of settlers to the indigenous population is not such as to have a decisive effect on any elections that may take place.  It remains the case that we have to look for a representative of the Turkish Cypriot community with whom business can be 	19900404a1181_13.txt

If the negotiators fail to reach a satisfactory outcome, they will have a heavy burden of guilt to carry.	19901204a203_1.txt

Gentleman's colleagues about the nature of the increase in wages that ambulance men would enjoy in the period from 1 April 1989 to 31 March 1990, which would be a 9 per cent.  increase.  	It is certainly true that the 9 per cent.  that was offered is over an 18-month period, and it is certainly true that, having had their 9 per cent.  increase, that would hold good until 30 September, when there would be an opportunity for further discussion about any increases subsequent to that.

It is certainly true that Greater Glasgow health board is rationalising services and that that will affect a number of hospitals.  I am clear, and I know that the hospital board is clear, that such changes are designed to consolidate and improve services provided to the community.

Answers to the converse question, when asked by opinion polls, show that only 4 per cent.  of the population support the continuation of deer hunting.  More to the point, perhaps, 	it is claimed that farmers and those who live in the Exmoor area and other areas in which deer hunting takes place support deer hunting.  That is simply not the case.

In the objections it was claimed that: The consultation period is unreasonably short …while 	it is claimed that the plans will improve liaison between Westminster Council and the Health Authority, the same argument has been totally ignored for Islington and Camden…Creation of a Camden Health Authority (by merging Bloomsbury and Hampstead Authorities) needs looking into …The merger of Islington and Bloomsbury Health Authorities will probably be followed by merging Hampstead Health Authority with them.

The judge said: 	It is common ground that all plaintiffs are entirely blameless … I believe that the legal profession has a duty to do its best to see that the legal system does not become a scapegoat in the eyes of the public for what I fear may be perceived as the unjust and inhumane denial of any significant measure of compensation to the plaintiffs.

It is common ground that the law in this sector is inadequate in some respects.

So 	it is common ground that there was a cataclysmic failure of an operation on my hon.  Friend's constituent.  I hope that my hon.

In 1989, 72 per cent.  of all women of working age had paid jobs of one kind or another and 29 per cent.  of them were part time.  	It is complacent nonsense to suggest that the reason they are part time is that they all passionately want to be part time.  The reason that they are part time is that they are looking after children.  In many ways that has to be in the public interest.  It is certainly the policy on this side of the House that women should have such a choice.  Twenty-nine per cent.  of 	19901212a1065_3.txt

It is complete nonsense to say that the Government who employ them should also be the authority that tries them.

Amnesty International presented to the Government 33 recommendations for changes in the treatment of asylum applications.  	It is concerned that people have been wrongly expelled, and gives a figure of 100.  It is interesting that in his reply to that, the Home Office Minister admitted that a number of Kurdish asylum seekers from Turkey had been wrongly deported in 1989 and that Sri Lankan Tamils had been deported.

I stress that such research is important to the national health service, and 	it is considerably to the credit of the pharmaceutical industry that its research effort, although essential to the industry's survival, makes a major contribution to the national effort to find new ways to treat disease and improve the condition off patients.

Secondly, the report states: 	It is considered that the staffing levels generally employed by Unitrust" — the security firm — at St.  Helier Hospital are adequate.  Although the report does not say — indeed, it could not, in the circumstances — that everything in the hospital is wonderful and no improvements can be made, it gives qualified support to the security policy pursued there and makes a number of detailed proposals for its improvement.

By convention, he recommended that the House give the Bill a Second Reading so that the Bill could be considered in detail by the Opposed Private Bill Committee.  	It is consistent with that approach that the Government support the carry-over motion.  In principle the Bill is acceptable to the Department.

It is equally important that economic reforms in the countries that will benefit should proceed apace to allow free enterprise to bring the benefits that have been brought elsewhere.

It took effect in April and 	it is estimated that it will help 20,000 families.  A further change that will help families with disabled children came into effect at the beginning of this month.  From October, we have introduced a carer's premium of £10 a week into income support for those receiving invalid care allowance.  We hope that that will help 30,000 carers.

Many businesses could not operate efficiently without cars.  Of the total stock of 20 million cars, 	it is estimated that 5 million are owned by businesses and 3 million owned by individuals are used on occasions for business purposes.  For a variety of reasons, not least that in the past they were very much undertaxed, company cars tend to be more prevalent in the United Kingdom than in other EC member states.  That is why it is important to consider carefully the tax regime which applies to them.  My 	19911220a574_0.txt

It is estimated that 216,000 people are available for YT, but that there are 244,000 places.  My hon.  Friend the Member for Norfolk, North has been a consistent advocate of workfare.

By far the biggest investment in health research is not in the public sector but in the private sector.  	It is estimated that our pharmaceutical industry invests £793 million a year in medical research.  I stress that such research is important to the national health service, and it is considerably to the credit of the pharmaceutical industry that its research effort, although essential to the industry's survival, makes a major contribution to the national effort to find new ways to treat disease and improve the condition off patients.

That figure of 3 per cent.  is an interesting statistic, because 	it is exactly the figure by which the Labour Government cut the revenue expenditure of the health service in real terms in 1977–78 — something that the Conservative Government have never done.  In 1977–78, Labour cut the revenue budget of the health service by the average amount by which it has grown in real terms since we came to power.

It is expected that the substantive post of director will be advertised in the next few months.  A major feature of the case that has caused public disquiet is the way that the courts kept children away from their families at the social services department's request without access.

Yesterday, he presented it at Question Time — not at such great length, but perhaps at more length than is usual on such occasions.  	It is extraordinary that an argument which is so widely supported in the Stockport area and which has been recognised to be powerful by many in the health service, including Health Ministers, should have elicited such a hostile reception yesterday from the hon.

In some health boards, screening will take place every three years.  A screening programme is in hand and 	it is extremely important that women in Scotland respond to invitations to take part.

It is for Parliament alone to describe the circumstances in which any citizen of this country can be compulsorily denied his liberty or be subjected to compulsory clinical investigation.

We shall make sure that 	it is handled properly and used in a way that tends to decentralise decision making in the Community.  My hon.  Friend is right to say that it alerts us to the inherent tedency in organisations of this type for decision making to migrate to the centre.

Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition committed the Labour party in government to raising NHS expenditure by 3 per cent.  above the inflation rate.  That is precisely what the Government have done during the 12 years that they have been in office.  	It is hard for the Labour party to argue that we are underfunding the health service, when our average increase over 12 years has been precisely what the leader of the Labour party said during the last election campaign would be his commitment.  If we move from revenue funding to capital funding, the facts are even more telling.  In the 12 years that we have been in office, the hospital service capital budget 	19910314a1236_1.txt

It is hard for Labour Members to argue that we are underfunding the service when we have increased the capital budget by 62 per cent.  in real terms after they had cut it in their period in office by 16 per cent.  in real terms.

Since this Government came to power, as I reminded the House, they have been cut, as they were during the period of the previous Tory Government in 1970–74.  So, since 1970, under both periods of Conservative rule, waiting lists have been cut; under the period of Labour rule, waiting lists rose by 50 per cent.  	It is hard for the Labour party to argue against that background that our waiting list record is somehow a measure of weak commitment to the health service.  Let me, however, give the hon.  Member for Peckham the defence, lest she should have forgotten it, to the charge that her party's record on waiting lists is not as good as she might wish it to be.

Sometimes I am shadowed by the deputy leader of the Labour party, sometimes by the chairman of the Labour party — 	it is hard to remember who he is these days — but I must point out that these debates deserve the attention of, and attendance in the House by, a member of the shadow Cabinet.  The absence of such a member shows the Opposition's reluctance to debate these matters and the contempt in which they hold the House.  I want to touch on the speech made by the hon.

They reflect the Government's commitment to delegated management — to enhancing the power, influence, discretion and flexibility that are available to local management, and returning to a local community the opportunity to run its own hospital.  	It is hard to argue that 57 individual decisions constitute gross centralisation.  The hon.  Member for Heywood and Middleton obliquely mentioned acute bed spaces in his questions about Manchester hospital provision.  It is important, in any assessment of the Government's record on the national health service, to look less at the number of people employed in the service and the amount spent on the service, and more at the number of 	19910314a1240_3.txt

I have heard less adverse comment about the commitment to a more effective, slimmer and more efficient health service than about all the other principles that come within the NHS reforms.  	It is hardly a secret that the reforms have generated a degree of interest and controversy.  Even the hon.  Member for Livingston (Mr.  Cook) could not make a leak out of that.  Within the national health service, this set of proposals is almost entirely uncontroversial.

It will be interesting also to discover whether Labour supports our action to eliminate secondary action.

We know from the hostility that, I am afraid to say, the Secretary of State shows to Conservative authorities that he dislikes and despises the idea that locally elected people should be there to speak up for the voters about the education service in their area.  	It is ironic that we are debating a guillotine motion on a Bill which dismembers Her Majesty's inspectorate after 150 years of fine service to education on the day of the publication of the last fully independent report — if the Government were elected — of Her Majesty's inspectorate.  The report spells out the need for a much stronger and more effective inspectorate, for it shows that 30 per cent.  of children in 	19920130a1129_0.txt

However, 	it is ironic that even in this debate on the guillotine motion, in which the Opposition Front Bench have said, "We will co-operate and we will not vote against you," in the two hours in which we have debated the motion, several Opposition Members have said, "No, we shall not accept that advice."

It is just as well that they were being photographed outside the building because those in wheelchairs could not have come inside to take part in a proper lobby.  As my hon.

We are putting our heads in the sand and ignoring the realities of life around us.

In considering whether the changes should be made permanent, 	it is legitimate to consider not only the fact that there is a £l million revenue saving for the health authority as a result, but the question of access for my hon.

It is ludicrous that one has to get a ticket to get off the train as well as on.  Clearly, if one has a ticket to get on a train, it is possible to get off it.

It is ludicrous to expect anyone to believe that those 175 inspectors could conceivably monitor the system over which they are supposed to have control.

That imaginative initiative is helping to turn the tide against burglary.  	It is mobilising everyone in the community so that burglars will be caught.  There are clear lessons of good practice here, which I know other areas in the Met are drawing on and other forces will be looking to.

The general view is that one should not extend aid of the type that we have been discussing unless there is clear evidence of progress towards political reform and economic liberalisation.  	It is most certainly true that Romania has made progress in both areas, but our own judgment — it is shared by the G24 meeting that took place at the end of October — is that sufficient progress has not yet been made.	19901128a855_1.txt

Will you confirm that 	it is most important that Members of Parliament should do that? Will you also confirm that at least three hon.

There have been some multiple applications and some court cases, and I will provide details of them.  The right hon.

There has been a stream of stories of that sort — perhaps, in a sense, to give credibility to the Asylum Bill, which I sincerely hope will be lost.  	It is my wish that the general election will arrive and spare us that awful legislation.  We are not discussing the specific terms of that Bill, but I think that we should put on record once again our continuing opposition to the measure.  The Asylum Bill would not give proper rights of appeal to those who are refused political asylum.  It would introduce a twin-track policy.  It would introduce fingerprinting 	19920302a61_0.txt

Then they discovered that the majority of people simply did not believe any of that, because they have some experience of the ambulance service.  	It is no accident that a petition expressing support for the ambulance workers contained nearly 5 million signatures.  It was the biggest petition ever presented to the House, certainly in the past 150 years.

I am sure that 	it is no accident that Mr.  Mellish has recently been promoted to assistant chief constable in another area.  I am in the happy position to report to this House on the many real successes of the Metropolitan police in 1990  — successes forged in partnership with the people of London.

Member for Garscadden whether the Labour party supports national testing.  	It is no good saying that testing is all right in one part of the country but not in another.  Testing either has a place in education and assessment practice or it has not.  The hon.  Member for Blackburn, who is the Labour party's education spokesman, seems to be clear on the matter.

The car scale structure, which has been in place in broadly its current form since the mid-1970s, has served us reasonably well.  However, 	it is no part of that structure to tax the business use of company cars; merely their private use.  The structure of the tax bands recognises the difference between high business mileage and the so-called perk car.

It is not just the admissions that determine bed availability, but whether a patient is discharged from hospital within a reasonably expected time.

Furthermore, there are some quite interesting statistics in the history of waiting lists.  	It is not only during the present period of Conservative government that we have been able to cut waiting lists.

We have, therefore, asked its chairman to make every effort to complete the commission's work within two years.

Most people in the mental illness world, although not all, recognise that in the past too many patients were put in unsuitable, large-scale hospitals where their clinical needs were not met.  It is not our policy to close all mental hospitals.  	It is our policy to ensure that patients who can most benefit from treatment in the community should have the opportunity to receive it and that those who need more structured support should have that support.  The facilities should be available to ensure that the clinical needs of each patient are met.  The context of Friern hospital is interesting.  The hon.

Gentleman asked for a change of policy that would ensure that, before people were discharged from long-stay hospitals, proper provision was made for them in the community.  That does not require a change of policy; it is the Government's policy.  	It is our policy that no one should be discharged from long-stay hospitals without the existence of a care programme that defines that person's needs — and, furthermore, naming an individual key worker who will be responsible for ensuring that the person receives the care that he requires.  The fact is that the hon.  Gentleman cannot support his assertions on the basis of the available evidence.	19920121a167_2.txt

Technical assistance to the Soviet Union is of the very greatest importance and, as he says, importance has been attached to it by all who have commented on the issue.  I think that the European Parliament also attaches great importance to it and 	it is our view and that of the Budget Council that there is room within the budget for such assistance to the Soviet Union without breaching the financial criteria in the way in which my hon.

However, where there are genuine clinical questions, those are not properly matters into which the ombudsman should inquire.  	It is particularly important to emphasise that merely to establish that they are clinical questions does not make them immune from review.  There is a procedure within the national health service to review clinical questions, but that is properly a procedure that has been agreed with the professions and that takes account of the special nature of clinical questions.  It is important to establish the difference between administrative and clinical questions, 	19910501a402_1.txt

Friend the Prime Minister's decision to convene the Security Council at the end of January, and 	it is partly that which explains the invitation to President Yeltsin to visit London.  As my right hon.

Before that time a restricted regime governed the sale of arms to Iraq.  	It is perfectly true that there has not been a prohibition on the sale of non-military products, but then again we trade with many, indeed all, nations.  We positively disagree with many of them.

Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Mr.  Deva) for pointing out the difference in the type and availability of schemes now available, compared with 1979.  We will not take any lessons from Labour about the importance of training young people.  We attach priority to it, and regard it as important.  In the same way, we believe that 	it is reasonable that adults who are unemployed and who wish to claim benefit should be obliged to be available for work and actively to seek it.  Our system places clear responsibilities on unemployed people to seek work.  That is a condition of benefit.  Unemployment benefit claimants have a duty under the benefit rules to be available for work and actively to seek it, and the Government have a duty to 	19921120a573_1.txt

General policy on prescription charges is one of the issues that has been hotly debated ever since the national health service was set up, and perhaps it is a debate which, over the years, has generated a great deal more heat than light.  It is hard to think of anything new to say on the subject of prescription charges after 40 years.  It remains the Government's view that 	it is reasonable that those who can afford to make a contribution towards the costs of medicines prescribed to them should do so, and that regimes of exemption from prescription charges should be properly directed and should be justified by medical or social considerations.  As a background to the debate it is worth remembering that, of more than £2 billion spent on pharmaceutical services, prescription charges now comprise £177 million, or roughly 8 per 	19900614a587_0.txt

It applies to the majority of company cars.  It has been applied more recently to mobile telephones.  The £200 charge that the hon.  Gentleman proposes is, of course, the same as that which applies to a mobile telephone.  I am not sure that 	it is reasonable to say that the value to the employee of the availability of a van is the same as that of a mobile telephone.  The most obvious difference is that the capital and running costs of a typical van — they must be taken into account in setting a scale benefit because it is an approximation of the value of the benefit — are considerably higher than those of a mobile 	19920707a299_0.txt

The hon.  Lady mentioned no-fault compensation.  That is an important issue.  For some time, the Opposition have agreed that the proper way in which to finance the health service is to do so within a cash-limited total resource.  	It is recognised that a free, publicly funded health service necessarily has limited resources: there is no longer any dispute about that.  As of last weekend, there also seems to be no dispute about the prospects of an immediate substantial increase in the resources available to the health service.  The Leader of the Opposition made it clear that he foresaw no such increase, except in the context of a growing economy.  	19910501a402_1.txt

It is right and proper that the issues that are of obvious and continuing concern to my hon.  Friend's constituents should detain the House this evening and that he should bring them to our attention.  The way in which my hon.

As for deterring people from leaving Vietnam in the first place, one reason why they leave is, of course, poverty in Vietnam — a country which is undergoing economic reform.

The House contains a fund of expertise and specialist knowledge to which Ministers are exposed in scrutiny debates and cannot fail to be influenced.  In many of the debates, my opening speech frequently resembled the process of giving evidence because there were frequent interventions from hon.  Members asking detailed factual questions or questions of principle.  	It is right that Ministers should be subjected to that cross-examination and required to answer to the House of Commons on the effects of any proposal and on the Government's position.  The proposed improvements will make that system an even stronger discipline.  My hon.

The purchasing power parity of sterling against the deutschmark throughout the last decade and more was a little above the central rate at which we joined the exchange rate mechanism, which suggests that the rate we chose was about right.  If 	it is right that that rate places exporters at such a crashing disadvantage, it is odd that when the rate of the pound against the deutschmark last summer was significantly above what it now is exporters were doing very well, particularly in their exports to Germany, which were booming.

It is right that we should recognise that certain consequences flow from that.  If a member state dislikes a proposal and judges its effects to be harmful, two courses are open to it.  The first is to agree to the measure but subsequently not to implement or enforce it, thus leaving it a dead letter.  The second course is to seek changes in negotiation to render it acceptable, and to reject 	19910626a1084_1.txt

I do not agree with that criticism, but before I come to the detail of what the Government are doing — withal the time permitted to me — 	it is right to say that British Coal provides considerable assistance in the mining areas of Yorkshire which have been affected by the pit closures.  British Coal Enterprise Limited was set up in 1984 to help create employment opportunities in the coalfield regions.

Therefore, as people have said elsewhere, 	it is right to go that extra mile to achieve peace.  We are strongly behind the suggestion made by President Bush that he should have the opportunity — himself and through emmissaries — to put the facts clearly to Saddam Hussein and his Foreign Minister.

In the area of propriety and regularity, 	it is rightly concerned to ensure that the funds that the House votes to the Executive are spent only for the purposes that the House has authorised and are properly accounted for.

The closure of acute beds occurred before 1979 and has gone on since then, and the major reason for 	it is that modern medicine is less traumatic, in the technical sense, for the patient: the patient recovers faster from an operation involving minimally invasive surgery than he did from the techniques of 15 or 20 years ago.

It is the nature of budgets that they are not easy to live within, but I think that the great majority of health authorities will find ways to live within those budgets.

In the interests of keeping public expenditure under control and of bearing down on inflation, on which we do not have the best record in Europe, I believe that there is a strong public policy case for looking once more at the question of pensions.

A number of other problems also exist, and 	it is to those that I turn my attention.  The Select Committee skated over the wide variety of problems that prevent many people from obtaining jobs.

When people speak about the declining British fleet, 	it is too often forgotten that the British shipping industry remains vigorous and forward-looking, It is essential that that message is stressed time and again, for we shall not get people to go into the industry if we hear nothing but doom and gloom and prophecies about things going wrong.

It is too simple to say that the only way to solve high crime rates is through more repression and more police.  Many other things must be done.

It is true that we currently produce around 1 million tonnes of oil seed rape a year.  Production of rape seed oil is encouraged under the EC oilseeds regime, under which subsidies are paid to processors of Community seed.  Oil seed rape is grown for the production of rape seed oil and meal, which are extracted from the seed by oil seed processors.  The oil is used mainly by the food industry, 	19900208a1128_0.txt

There have been no cuts in the national health service.  The NHS has been the beneficiary of substantial additional investment.  	It is true that Greater Glasgow health board is rationalising its services and that that affects a large number of hospitals, Stobhill being one.

The increased expenditure on the national health service in Scotland amounts to more than the entire receipts that the Government obtain from North sea oil in any one year and represents a huge increase in resources.  	It is true that the cost of eye tests and dental check-ups, the abolition of competitive tendering and the introduction of a minimum wage would add £125 million to the cost of the national health service in Scotland.

One assault is one too many and we must address people's fears and apprehensions just as seriously as actual dangers to their safety.  However, 	it is true that the vast majority of those using buses and trains do so in complete safety as the risk of attack remains very low.  As one example of our commitment to safety and security on public transport, the Government recently published — in conjunction with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, transport operators and the transport police — a booklet entitled "Travel Safely on Public Transport", which gives practical advice to passengers on 	19910520a758_0.txt

The hon.  Gentleman also alleged that no funding was available for vaccination, but I suppose that that is ritual comment on any subject to do with the national health service.  	It is true that there is not special central funding, and nor should there be.  We are talking about relatively small sums of money in the £29 billion budget of the Department of Health.  It is an entirely proper obligation for health authorities, on behalf of their populations, to make such protection available to high-risk groups, and there is no serious evidence to support the view that vaccination has not been 	19900710a288_0.txt

Where there is a public health concern, it is in everyone's interests, including the undertaking's, that the facts are published immediately.  That did not happen in this case and it is a cause of legitimate criticism which is accepted by the South West water authority.  It is important for us to control such criticism because, although 	it is true that the authority did not act as it should have acted at the time of the incident, that shortcoming was addressed within two months of the incident, and that addressing of the issue is now more than two years ago.

Whether the extra ward is funded by the regional health authority or by private capital, the issue clearly needs to be examined to find out whether the additional ward would provide the relatively low marginal cost benefit to patients on the waiting list.  I shall certainly ensure that the proposal is carefully examined.  If 	it is true that for the relatively modest expenditure involved in providing an additional ward in the hospital the rest of the resources, not least the £2·7 million new third operating theatre coming on stream in April 1992, could be used more effectively to produce a lower average cost per operation and to treat more patients within the hospital as a result of having an additional ward, that is clearly a powerful argument 	19910328a1152_0.txt

It is true that the services provided by any SHA are available to the whole NHS.  It is part of the purpose of the SHA system that those authorities should develop the delivery of health care and that the results of their experience should be available widely through the health service.

Therefore, however flexible the mechanism may be, they would not operate it.  	It is true that doctors and medical staff have been leaving Libya, but that has as much to do with the fact that they have not been paid as with any other consideration that the hon.

I believe that 	it is true to say that under the old system those who presented themselves at a hospital and knew how to get to the front of the queue tended to get better care than did those who were less skilled at working the system.

I thought that the Home Secretary conceded that there was now an argument for a democratically run police force in London.  He did not agree with the argument, but at least he conceded that a valid argument was being made.  Many of us have advanced that argument year after year.  	It is unacceptable that what pertains elsewhere in the country, where there is a degree of democratic involvement with the running of police forces and the local authorities, does not apply to London.  A vast amount of public expenditure goes to the police force in London which impinges on the lives of every citizen in London in some form or another.  They surely have a say in the overall policing policy 	19921023a713_0.txt

LBL is concerned with the safety of its bus crews, as well as its passengers.  As the hon.  Lady said, some attacks on crews are despicable in the extreme.  Indeed, assaults on bus crews are much more prevalent than assaults on passengers.  	It is unacceptable that men and women should be subjected to the risk of attack simply through doing their job, and I fully support the measures that LBL is taking to reduce that risk.

Nothing daunted, the Labour Front Bench spokesmen went on to talk about nursing home charges, and nursing homes are an important issue.  I had thought that the policy in the White Paper "Caring for People" was a bipartisan one.  The Labour party is explicitly committed to supporting it, and 	it is under that policy that those who need nursing care are provided with it, in the community, in private sector nursing homes.  That policy has abolished a waiting list that we inherited in 1979 — that for part III accommodation, social care in local authorities.

We all know what a vital role was played by our merchant ships at the time of the Falklands crisis, and I cannot pay too high a tribute to the skills and courage of the British seafarers who manned those ships.  	It is understandable that concern should be expressed about the size of the fleet having declined since then.  Hon.  Members can, however, be assured that we monitor the fleet's capability to support our armed forces in times of crisis.  My right hon.

It is understandable that many couples in Britain, where the number of babies available for adoption has fallen sharply in recent years, want to adopt a child from overseas.

My hon.

Having acknowledged the marvellous job done by the ambulance service, I must add that 	it is unfortunate that there should be industrial action in pursuit of a pay claim within that service, because there is no doubt that it is causing substantial disruption to the service and serious damage to patient care.

I do not believe that it would be lawful unless it were underpinned by some appropriate resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations.  	It is unlikely that we would get such authority at the moment.  The same applies to air interdiction.  That will not be successful unless it is backed by the readiness to fire.  That, too, is an act of war.  That being so, in the absence of the Security Council resolution it would not be justified or, indeed, possible.  Therefore, for the moment I could not commend either proposition to the House.  	19911113a1207_0.txt

It is well known that the Education (Schools) Bill, which seeks to privatise the schools' inspectorate, is a matter of great controversy.  The Bill is based partly on an internal review of Her Majesty's inspectorate which the Secretary of State has refused to publish.

Earlier, the Secretary of State wriggled and wriggled on that parallel, but 	it is well known that those trusts sought to argue that, as they were semi-privatised.  they should have the right to appoint their own auditors, as though they were the shareholders of their trusts' property.

Only about one case in three succeeds and 	it is widely considered unfair that only the most persistent litigant does so.

No matter how compelling the squatters' own circumstances are claimed to be by their apologists, 	it is wrong that legitimate occupants should be deprived of the use of their property.  The paper which I am publishing today is not concerned with spurious arguments which claim to justify squatting.

At last July's meeting of the National Economic Development Council 	it was a pleasant surprise to find that even the Trades Union Congress was reasonably positive.  Its general secretary declared himself to be a "not unsceptical convert" to the cause.  I suppose that that is a start.

He rightly said that there were two on duty that night — but he did not say that 	it was a Saturday night and that there were five patients on the ward.  Two nurses for five patients on a Saturday night cannot be said to represent thin staffing levels, and I do not believe that the right response to a security problem is necessarily an increase in staff nursing levels.  More important, perhaps, is the fact that we should not try to debate specific security precautions — in a specific 	19901129a1104_0.txt

There were about 1 million in northern Iran and about 70,000 in southern Iran.  That was indeed a people in flight.  	It was a tragedy on a scale that is seldom seen.  Since then, as the House is aware, the position has improved substantially — at least in north Iraq.  All the refugees on the mountains within the allied controlled zone have returned to Iraq.  The mountain refugee camps are closed and the transit stations are almost deserted.  The towns of Zakho and Dahuk, together with most other towns and villages, are returning 	19910703a374_0.txt

Far from there being a constant flow of resources and aid from northern countries to southern countries, the opposite is the case, and has been for most of the past 200 years.

It was about ensuring that the work, the raw materials and the food of the poorer countries flowed out to the richest parts of the world.  That is the legacy of colonialism and imperialism that we have to deal with today.

Back in 1986, a new salary structure was agreed for the ambulance service, which included revised working practices and improved conditions.  	It was acknowledged by everyone on all sides that that represented a good deal for the ambulance service.  I have examined what had happened to prices and to wages in the ambulance service since that good deal was obtained.  I discovered that prices to April 1989 have gone up by 23 per cent.  and the pay of ambulance men, including the current offer which applies from April 1989, has gone up by 31 per cent.  	19900219a676_3.txt

As 	it was alleged that the men were beaten up, the custody sergeant would have had to decide whether a doctor should be called to examine the arrested men.

It was also entitled to ensure that the GP who made the referral understood the implications of his decision.

That is just a flavour of the spirit — I accept that it was sincere — in which the exercise was embarked upon all those years ago.  	It was believed that the process of state ownership would create dynamic companies with a work force driven to Stakhanovite effort by the knowledge that they were working, not for themselves, wicked capitalists or coal owners, but for society.

It was claimed that the order would have been within the purpose of the Act because the conversion of the dock to a marina would have constituted an improvement.  However, I decided on legal advice last October that that would not be an improvement within the meaning of the Act and thus that an order for the purpose would not be lawful.

It also expressed anxiety at the quality of entrants to teacher training in those subjects and said that 	it was concerned that institutions may be finding it increasingly difficult to maintain even current entry standards.  Those standards are already far too low, and far too many are going into postgraduate teacher education in the key areas of science without the adequate degree qualifications.

It was the main objection to that system of inspection.  The right hon.  Member for Henley said in the House at the time that 	it was crucially important that not only should the auditing of local authorities be independent, but that it should be seen to be independent.  Rather than allow local authorities to decide, the Audit Commission was given powers, under its enabling legislation, to determine who should audit their accounts.

Many brave people have stood up against racist violence and racist attacks in Germany, and it is sad that the outrages still continue.  	It was highly appropriate that last year, on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, there was a demonstration outside the German embassy.

In the previous Session, the Government introduced the Environmental Protection Bill, which completed all its stages.  	It was laudable in the sense that it was designed to ensure that people would drop less litter and it provided for more recycling of goods.

I should say that 	it was never really by design that social security became a major funding source for the private or voluntary sectors.

However, the introduction of a no-fault compensation scheme in which the board could initiate action may well result — in fact, I am certain that it would result — in more such cases and 	19910201a1254_1.txt
733	 I do not want to be tempted down the road of censorship, because it would be exceptionally difficult to control the media in such a situation — and, where an event is so visual and obvious, it would not be appropriate.  On reflection, I believe that the very fact that 	it was such a dramatic riot and that it was seen in other prisons encouraged some of the disturbances a week later.  I recognise what the hon.  Gentleman said about the staff whom he met at Christmas.  They will read his comments in Hansard when it is published, but I pay tribute to them, too.  Prison officers are very proud of their work and the more recognition that is paid to 	19910225a667_0.txt
734	 As the hon.  Member for Wrexham (Dr.  Marek) eventually managed to sort out, there are two broad groups of amendments: one makes a silly point and the other a bad one.  The bad point is about the time from which the welcome relief from stamp duty comes into force.  He said that it should have been introduced earlier because 	it was terribly unfair that people who had already had their documents stamped would be denied the relief.  Whenever any change is made to any taxation, some people fall on the helpful side and some people fall on the unhelpful side.  That is simply a fact of life.  If one makes the date 10 December, 10 November or 10 January, there will still be a line, and some people will fall on one side 	19920120a143_6.txt

The hon.  Gentleman quoted from a speech made by my hon.  Friend in 1985.  That speech made manifest her understanding of the subject, and in it she laid down the guiding priority for any discussion on the matter.  	It was that we must not fall into the trap of sensationalising what happens, which is the practice of the tabloid press.  We must conduct a calm and deliberate investigation, apply the lessons and try to ensure that people do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  It is fitting that it should be my hon.  Friend the Minister for Health who has responsibility for implementing the Children Act 1989, which grew 	19910328a1130_0.txt

Gentleman asked why a small minority of water authorities had allowed the maceration process to continue over a period of years.  I am advised that no narrowly defined health hazard arises from the process.  However, that in no way invalidates the proposition that an issue of public taste and standards arises from that method of disposal, and 	it was the acceptance of that which led my hon.  Friend the Minister for Health to intervene in the way she did.  My hon.  Friend's intervention was motivated and governed by precisely the approach adopted by the Polkinghorne committee — that the disposal of foetal remains should be governed by the principle that foetal remains had before abortion the potential for developing into fully fledged human life and are entitled to 	19911126a888_2.txt
737	 The hon.  Lady is right to say that three or four schools out of hundreds that have opted out in Lancashire were starved of cash for their capital building needs.  Where she is wrong — she knows this — is in suggesting that Lancashire county council is responsible.  She came with me on deputation after deputation to Ministers, and she knows that 	it was the Conservative Government who starved the schools of funds, not the failure of Lancashire county council.  The question raised by the Catholic bishops and the question now being raised by governors, parents and local authorities throughout the land is whether the bribes can continue.  I put the question to the Secretary of State, and I ask him to answer it.  If, as the Government predict, 2,000 more schools opt out, 	19920512a581_1.txt

739	  Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Majesty for the Gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament.  Those hon.  Members who were in the House back in 1979 may have a short and lingering memory of the Loyal Address on that occasion.  	It was the first speech that was sound broadcast in the House of Commons, which shows the extent of the changes that have occurred during the past 13 years.  On that occasion, I had the great honour on behalf of my constituents in Mole Valley to second the motion on the Loyal Address, and now, some 13 years later, I have been given the extra honour of proposing the motion.  Much has happened 	19920506a53_3.txt
740	 Yes, it was when he was first Secretary of State for the Environment.  Now he is their last Secretary of State for the Environment.  The Audit Commission was established in 1981–82 because of worries about inconsistent standards in the inspection of local authorities' accounts.  One of the main concerns of the Government and the public at that stage was that local authorities were allowed to pick and pay their auditors.  	It was the main objection to that system of inspection.  The right hon.  Member for Henley said in the House at the time that it was crucially important that not only should the auditing of local authorities be independent, but that it should be seen to be independent.  Rather than allow local authorities to decide, the Audit Commission was given powers, under its enabling legislation, to determine who should audit their 	19920129a1011_1.txt

This abuse of the private Bill procedure is growing.  The procedure was introduced as a form of planning control for major harbour and railway developments.  	It was the only form of planning control that existed at that time.  There was no local government framework capable of dealing with planning, and Parliament deemed this an appropriate form of control.  There would be no point in going into how the railways were built and into the procedures that had to be followed.  However, one has to ask whether, in this age, it is appropriate that an enormously important 	19900208a1087_2.txt

May I make it absolutely clear that it has not been the policy of this Government or any previous Government to undermine the independence of UKIAS and the advice that it gives.  All those who have been connected with UKIAS during the past few months will have regretted what 	19920121a194_2.txt

The involvement in Bosnia demonstrates clearly the complex situation faced by United Nations forces on the ground — the appalling combination of ethnic conflict, territorial disputes and humanitarian tragedy is, unfortunately, becoming more and more commonplace, and does not make it an easy environment for United Nations troops.  The increase in the range and complexity of peacekeeping operations is putting enormous pressure on the Secretary-General and his staff.  	It was the recognition of this new environment that lay behind my right hon.  Friend the Prime Minister's proposal at the Security Council last January, endorsed by colleagues, for a report on ways in which the United Nations could reinforce its capacity for preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peacemaking.  The Secretary-General's report in response to this proposal was published in July.  As my right hon.  Friend the Secretary of 	19921126a1094_0.txt
744	  Derbyshire set sail on 11 July 1980, from the port of Sept-Iles, Canada with a cargo of iron ore concentrates, bound for Japan.  The last radio message from the Derbyshire was received on 9 September 1980.  The ship tragically never arrived at her destination, and was presumed lost at sea with all 42 crew and two wives.  No material evidence as to the cause of the loss came to light at the time, and 	it was thought then that a formal investigation under the Merchant Shipping Acts would serve no useful purpose.  However, the Department commissioned extensive research into the ship's structural design and investigated reports of defects in sister ships.  In 1986, as the hon.  Gentleman pointed out, a sister ship of the Derbyshire, the Kowloon Bridge, ran aground on rocks near Baltimore, Republic of Ireland.  In December that year, my hon.  Friend the 	19901206a558_0.txt

The key point about the Leeds case is that, whatever the motivation of the managers in bringing the case, if their arguments were sustained in court, the effect would not be to reopen the transitional arrangements argument which we conducted and concluded in the House last year.  Instead, it would render invalid the basis on which composite rate tax was collected for four financial years, to the tune of £15 billion.  	It was to put that question beyond doubt that I announced last week that we intend to introduce certain clauses in the Finance Bill.  I entirely agree with my hon.  Friend the Member for Eltham about the importance of building society managers seeking opportunities to finance not merely the purchase of houses but the development and building of imaginative housing schemes.

It was also a signal to the rest of the world that we did not care about cultural and scientific aspects of UN operations or about the rest of the world.  I disagree with the hon.  Member for Bexleyheath, because I think that one of UNESCO's most important contributions was its attempt at setting up a world information agency.  	It was trying to ensure that the pro-western bias in the world's media-gathering agencies was at least in part redressed.  The new UN Secretary-General, Dr.  Boutros Ghali, has produced a report on how he sees the UN and its agencies developing.  It is important that he has done that and useful that he has set out his objectives.  Although I do not agree with all the objectives 	19921204a540_0.txt

Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr.  Stewart), who made an outstanding speech.  The Labour party has argued repeatedly that the only thing wrong with the health service is that it does not have enough money in it.  In 1987, the Labour party argued that 	it was underfunded and that it needed to be funded to the extent of 3 per cent.  real growth per year.  We have increased its real spending by 3·5 per cent.  a year, but the Labour party says that it is still underfunded and that that is the only thing wrong with it.  Labour cannot admit that there might be anything wrong with the way in which the NHS turns that money into 	19910515a372_1.txt

The commanding heights of the economy — railway, coal, steel, gas, electricity and companies such as Cable and Wireless, all the way through to Pickfords and Thomas Cook all fell sway to state ownership.  I do not blame Labour for that.  	It was warned at the time that the policy would be disastrous — which it was.  However, Labour was in the grip of a dogma, and those who are in the grip of a dogma do not always respond rationally to warnings.  Of course, many other countries apart from Britain were doing likewise.  In eastern Europe, not only the commanding heights but the sunlit uplands, the deeps of the valleys and every 	19910607a506_1.txt

Member for Sedgefield has said that the Opposition will not defend the closed shop when the Government move to outlaw it in the Employment Bill.  That is quite a change on the road to Damascus.  When did Labour decide not to support the closed shop? 	It was when it realised that we intended to take action.  Labour realised that it would be totally indefensible to defend the closed shop in debates in the House and throughout the country.  That is another example of Labour trimming its previous views.  The Employment Bill contains many other new measures.  It will be interesting to see whether Labour supports our proposals to abolish wildcat strikes, which will mean extending the 	19900119a564_0.txt

I hope that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, will feel that the Government are conscious of the obligations that they owe as a permanent member.  	It was with that consideration in mind, at least in part, that we deployed about 2,000 men to what was Yugoslavia, making us the second largest troop contributor to the region.
